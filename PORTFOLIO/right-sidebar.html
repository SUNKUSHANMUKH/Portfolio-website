										<h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
										<p>	The mixed waste is sorted based on the conventional methods at the industrial level. Normally most of the unused and waste materials are found to be metal, glass, plastic etc. These materials can be recycled for further use. The first step towards recycling is the segregation of waste. The primary aim of objective of proposed work is to segregate materials  such as metals, plastic bottles, glass and bottles . Here two sensors are used namely inductive proximity sensor and capacitive proximity sensor. For level detection infrared sensors are used to indicate the bins are full. 
											<BR>The three materials found mostly in solid waste are Metal, Glass and Plastic. These are the materials that can be recycled and the first step towards recycling is segregation. There are numerous benefits of recycling the waste materials. Scrap shops play a vital role in maintenance of solid waste that is generated. Scrap consists of recyclable materials that are byproducts from product consumption and manufacturing, such as parts of vehicles, building supplies, and surplus materials. Scrap has economic value, particularly recovered metals, and non-metallic materials are also recovered for recycling. Recycling of scrap materials is the key for effective waste management and it’s economical too. The methodology adopted in this paper to resolve the issue of waste segregation is by making the entire process automated and to the reduce cost such that it could be adapted in a scrap industry</p>

											<h3>PROBLEM</h3>
											<p>The nation and world is facing a huge problem today of disposal, segregation and recycling of solid waste, and improper management of these wastes are hazardous and dangerous to human health and ecological system. There is a rapid increase in capacity and categories of solid waste as a result of urbanization, constant economic growth, and industrialization. Global Waste Management Market reported that the amount of waste generated worldwide produced is 2.02 billion tones. “Wastes are not always waste if it is segregated as it was”. To properly manage the waste it has to be handled, segregated, transported and disposed so as to reduce the risks to the public lives and sustainable environmental. The economic value of waste is best comprehended when it is segregated. Currently there is no such system employed of segregation of glass, plastic and metallic wastes at industrial level.</p>

											<h3>APPROACH</h3>
											<p>This paper proposes an Automation of Waste material Segregation in scrap industry. This method is easy and simple solution of segregation of three types of wastes glass, metal and plastic. It is designed to sort the trash into metallic waste, plastic waste and glass waste ready to be processed separately for the next process of operation. The Method uses inductive sensors metallic items, and capacitive sensors to distinguish between and dry waste. Experimental results show that the segregation of waste into metallic, plastic and glass waste has been successfully implemented using the Automation of material segregation (AMS) method.</p>
